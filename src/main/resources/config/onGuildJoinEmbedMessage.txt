This Discord bot will use one of your channels as storage for different SoloQ rankings made in the server.
The complete use of my commands is only given to the users with a role named "%s" (which I already created myself). Otherwise, just '/helpRanky' and '/ranking' are open to the users.
This channel is referred to as "%s" (I already created it as well) and only uses the last %d messages as storage. So please do not spam in it. If something escapes the threshold I won't be able to retrieve it anymore.

-/create "RANKINGNAME" creates a ranking with that name.
-/addAccount "RANKINGNAME" ACCOUNT adds the account to the ranking if it exists. Supports spaces in the name.
-/addMultiple "RANKINGNAME" ACCOUNT1,ACCOUNT2... adds all the accounts to the ranking if they exist.
-/removeAccount "RANKINGNAME" ACCOUNT removes the account from the ranking if it exists.
-/ranking "RANKINGNAME" gives the soloQ information of the accounts in the ranking ordered by rank.
