This Discord bot will use one of your channels as storage for different SoloQ rankings made in the server.
The complete use of my commands is only given to the users with a role named "%s" (which I already created myself). Otherwise, just '/help_ranky' and '/ranking' are open to the users.
This channel is referred to as "%s" (I already created it as well) and only uses the last %d messages as storage. So please do not spam in it. If something escapes the threshold I won't be able to retrieve it anymore.

- /create :RANKINGNAME: creates a ranking with that name. (Role protected command)
- /delete :RANKINGNAME: deletes a ranking with that name. (Role protected command)
- /add_accounts :RANKINGNAME: ACCOUNTS... Adds the given accounts to the ranking (being separated by a comma (','). (format: summonerName#tagLine,summonerName#tagLine...) (Role protected command)
- /remove_accounts :RANKINGNAME: ACCOUNTS... Removes the given accounts from the ranking (being separated by a comma (','). (format: summonerName#tagLine,summonerName#tagLine...) (Role protected command)
- /ranking :RANKINGNAME: gives the soloQ information of the accounts in the ranking ordered by rank
