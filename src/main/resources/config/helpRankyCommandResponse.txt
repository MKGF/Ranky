This Discord bot will use one of your channels as storage for different SoloQ rankings made in the server.
This channel is referred to as #config-channel and only uses the last %d messages as storage. So please do not spam in it. If something escapes the threshold it won't be able to retrieve it anymore.
- /create \"RANKINGNAME\" creates a ranking with that name.
- /addAccount \"RANKINGNAME\" ACCOUNT adds the account to the ranking if it exists. Supports spaces in the name.
- /addMultiple \"RANKINGNAME\" ACCOUNT1,ACCOUNT2... adds all the accounts to the ranking if they exist.
- /removeAccount \"RANKINGNAME\" ACCOUNT removes the account from the ranking if it exists.
- /ranking \"RANKINGNAME\" gives the soloQ information of the accounts in the ranking ordered by rank, along with a bubble that displays whether the player is in game or not and the link to the user's stream in case there is any.
